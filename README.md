# Vershio

## 💡 Inspiration

We wanted to make something that would help students out.  As students, we know the importance of having access to knowledge in an easy to understand words and phrases. So we designed something that will give students everywhere access to this information, add to our index, and share knowledge.

## 💻 What it does

- Take a picture or upload a video copyright-free using our web app. 
- Our state-of-the-art machine learning platform allows us to extract only what's truly important.
- It provides summaries so that students get free information in less time than it takes to.
- It makes the info available for searching and viewing, there for all the world to see!

## 🔨 How we built it

- Planning: Finding an idea, divvying up tasks, and seeing if we’re crazy enough to make an attempt.
- LoFi Designs: Creating low fidelity versions of our product, figuring out how we can apply machine learning.
- HiFi Designs: Constructing detailed plans for how it’s going to work
- Development: Developing the product based on our designs.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Getting Claire to join our team’s notion
- Recovering from one of our _beloved_  ex-teammates dropping out

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

Completing an aesthetically pleasing and functioning website despite time constraints, coding hiccups, and team member time differences.
